Top 10 Restaurants Website
Create a website of your Top 10 restaurants.
This is an exercise in the use of HTML, CSS, flex, and animations

Use a 1 | 2 | 3 column layout using flex
Experiment with CSS animations to give your website visual interest
Spend minimal time on what images you want on the page and more time using CSS to get the website to look how you want.
Some CSS to include should be color, text-align, font-style, font-weight, font-family and font-size
Create classes in your HTML and apply styling to those classes using CSS.
Be sure to name your HTML divs when defining a section in the document.
Use HTML 5 semantic elements when necessary.
Use float on the images.
In the footer put some social icons and animate them.
